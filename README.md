Hi, Iâ€™m Haashim Ahmed.I have experience coding in Java, which I am currently studying in an online course.
I have completed part 1 and part 2 of this Java course.
So far, I have studied classes, control flow, refactoring, inheritance, and polymorphism. 
Also, I have developed a banking application and a mortgage calculator app.
Additionally I have experience in front-end languages, as I studied HTML and CSS in college, where I also developed a job application website.
Additionally, I have experience with project management methodologies and databases.
